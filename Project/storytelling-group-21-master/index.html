  pleasant emotional states, such as joy, amusement, satisfaction, gratification, euphoria, and
  triumph. Many factors play a role in the happiness of an individual, when defining the happiness
  index across countries many attributes play a factor like Democratic Quality, GDP Per Capita,
  Social Support for an individual, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Corruption, Confidence in National

<h3>Life Changes and so does Happiness</h3>
<div id="Q2para">
  Happiness is a state of well-being that encompasses living a good life. Happiness is subjective
  and can change over time or due to certain conditions as well. When you ask an individual
  about his happiness at a particular time his answer will depend on the recent happenings in life,
  with that being said it may happen that his answer will change after a given period of time. For
  most of the countries, the happiness index has only increased over time from 2010 to 2018 for
  countries like Iceland, Finland Which were in the top happy to begin with in 2010. Malawi and
  Syria have a maximum deficit in happiness from 2010 to 2018 and these countries were part of
  bottom happy countries.
